Given the Phase 1 model's role as a weak learner, the collected dataset of 27,560 pre-processed documents provides a sufficient foundation for initial model training, while the process's design to identify and annotate exemplars facilitates the creation of a labeled dataset for future, more advanced model iterations. By focusing on real-world, enterprise-specific data rather than generic public datasets, the process ensures relevance to Wells Fargoâ€™s remediation needs, laying a robust groundwork for iterative model improvement and enhanced data collection in subsequent phases.
